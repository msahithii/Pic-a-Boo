This repository implements an object detection application that allows you to:

Scan Images: Use your device's camera to capture an image in real-time for object detection.
Upload Images: Select existing images from your device's gallery for analysis.
The app leverages a pre-trained object detection model to identify objects within the images and displays the following information for each detected object:

Object Title: The name of the recognized object.
Accuracy Percentage: The confidence level (between 0% and 100%) of the model's prediction.
